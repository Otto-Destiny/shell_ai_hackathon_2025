## Technical Implementation

### Multi-Objective Optimization Framework

The engine employs **NSGA-II**, a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm that:

1. **Maintains Population Diversity**: Prevents premature convergence
2. **Generates Pareto Front**: Provides multiple trade-off solutions
3. **Handles Non-dominated Sorting**: Efficiently ranks solutions
4. **Supports Elitism**: Preserves best solutions across generations

### Constraint Management Strategy

#### **Frozen Constraints**
- Properties 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10 can be fixed as hard constraints
- Violation tolerance: `ε = 1e-3`
- Automatic filtering of non-optimizable properties

#### **Sum-to-One Constraint**
- Handled via custom `NormalizationRepair` operator
- Applied after each generation to ensure valid fractions
- More efficient than penalty-based approaches

### Mathematical Formulation

**Objective Functions:**
- **Primary**: Minimize property prediction error
  ```
  f₁(x) = Σ(predicted_properties - target_properties)²
  ```
- **Secondary**: Minimize total cost (optional)
  ```
  f₂(x) = Σ(component_fractions × component_costs)
  ```

**Constraints:**
- **Equality**: `Σ fractions = 1`
- **Bounds**: `0 ≤ fraction_i ≤ 1`
- **Fixed Properties**: `|predicted - target| ≤ ε`

## Advanced Algorithms

### Error Minimization Strategy
The system uses **sum of squared errors** for property matching:
```python
error = np.sum((predicted_properties - targets)**2, axis=1)
```

**Advantages:**
- Penalizes large deviations more heavily
- Smooth gradient for optimization algorithms
- Natural handling of multi-property objectives

### Cost Optimization Integration
When cost optimization is enabled, the system becomes truly multi-objective:
```python
if self.optimize_cost:
    cost = x @ self.component_costs
    out["F"] = np.column_stack([error, cost])
```

This creates a **Pareto optimization problem** where users can choose between:
- High accuracy, higher cost solutions
- Lower accuracy, cost-effective solutions
- Balanced trade-off solutions
